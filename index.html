            <p>
              I am a disciplined and driven student with a clear ambition to pursue a career in the IT field. 
              Currently, I am studying for a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science at Queen's University Belfast, 
              where I have developed a strong foundation in Java. 
              My studies have sharpened my problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills, 
              particularly through the application of these programming languages and mathematical problems.
          </p>
          
          <p>
              In addition to my formal education, I have taken the initiative to further my knowledge 
              through independent learning, particularly in Python. 
              This self-directed study has allowed me to solidify my understanding 
              and expand my capabilities beyond the classroom.
          </p>
          
          <p>
              My passion for IT is complemented by practical skills I have honed through various experiences, 
              including coding projects, playing football, and working as a customer sales assistent B&M. 
              These experiences have instilled in me a strong work ethic, teamwork, and time management skills. 
              I am determined to contribute to the IT industry by leveraging my technical skills, enthusiasm, 
              and dedication to continuous learning.
          </p>
          
          <p>
              I am eager to begin my career in IT, where I can apply my knowledge, 
              continue to grow, and add value to the industry.
          </p>
