                      I have been a Christian ever since I was 14 and
                      I don't regret the decision.
                      I go to a Methodist church and listen to what God wants to tell me. 
                      My favourite passage from the Bible is:Â 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Proverbs 3:5-6
                      Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
                      In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

                    In my free time, I immerse myself in a variety of hobbies that balance both intellectual stimulation and physical activity. 
                    I have a passion for reading, which allows me to explore diverse perspectives and deepen my understanding of various subjects. 
                    Additionally, I enjoy learning new programming languages and coding techniques, constantly expanding my skill set in the ever-evolving world of technology. 
                    On the athletic side, I play football, go to the gym tennis, and golf with my friends, appreciating the strategy, skill, and discipline these sports demand. 
                    I also indulge in video games, which not only offer entertainment but also sharpen my problem-solving abilities and strategic thinking. 
                    </p>
                    These hobbies collectively fuel my curiosity, keep me engaged, and contribute to my personal and professional growth.

                    Over the past two years, 
                    I've achieved significant personal milestones, 
                    which is successfully losing 22kg, 
                    which reflects my dedication to health and well-being. 
                    Within the same period, 
                    I earned the position of prefect at a new school, 
                    demonstrating my leadership abilities and adaptability. 
                    I am deeply passionate about faith and community service, 
                    and I aspire to become more involved in church activities, 
                    helping others in their spiritual journey. Professionally, 
                    I aim to secure a role at a leading tech company, 
                    where I can apply and develop my skills.
                    I am committed to reaching a target weight of 62kg, 
                    as part of my ongoing efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
